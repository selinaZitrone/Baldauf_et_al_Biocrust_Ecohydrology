This folder contains all analysis scripts to analyse the model results and 
produce the figures from the paper.

- `/helper_functions/read_spatial.R`: Function that can be used to read spatial
model output

- `1_spatial_results_hillslope.R`: Read and analyse the monthly mean hydrological
processes and plot them in maps. Used for Figure 3 and S5-8

- `2_spatial_results_transect.R`: Read and analyse monthyl mean hydrological
processes and plot them in the spatio-temporal hillslope plots. Used for Figure 4 and
S10

- `3_landscape_soil_moisture.R`: Reproduce Figures 4, S9 for hillslope scale soil moisture
with and without biocrusts.

- `4_compare_biocrusts.R`: Reproduce Figure 5 to compare the effects of different biocrusts
in the whole landscape and Figure S11 for moisture in the vegetated cells
